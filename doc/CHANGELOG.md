## Latest changes

## Release 2.6.0
#### :ghost: Maintenance
* Fix map matching with AltitudeUnknown
* Remove Ubuntu 16.04 support

## Release 2.5.1
#### :ghost: Maintenance
* Fix ENU conversion of OpenDrive imports

## Release 2.5.0
#### :ghost: Maintenance
* Ease version number handling and folder layout
* Route planning fixes and extensions
  - Split CoreIntersection parts from Intersection wich are independant from
    the route and right-of-way handling. And fixed outgoingParaPoints()
  - Extend map matching, route prediction and connecting route handling by
    relevantLane parameter to restrict the functionality to a fixed subset
    of the map.
  - Added route::planning::predictRoutesDirectionless().
  - Made operation mode of route::planning::filterDuplicateRoutes() and all
    of the route::planning::predictRoute*() functions configurable
  - Fixed the search for start interval in
    route::planning::compareRoutesOnIntervalLevel() and made function
    public.
  - route::extendRouteToDistance() considers the shorter version of the
    expanded routes instead of larger to prevent consecutive route
    expansions to overlook possible routes through the intersection;
  - route::calculateConnectingRoute() considers not only the shortest
    connecting route, but judges also the feasibility of the connecting
    route based on the actual heading differences in respect to the route.
    This prevents from selecting e.g. wrong 90Â° crossing lanes with very
    small connecting route because vehicles would drive there side by side.
  - route::alignRoute{Ending|Starting}Points() prevent from invalid or
    unnecesary alignments.
  - route: :planning::RouteAStar/RoutePrediction: handle
    RoutingDirection: :DONT_CARE as input correctly

  - The occupied regions only consider longitudinal in-lane matches
* Removed misleading functions route::getRouteIntervalStart/End(LaneInterval); directly use the LaneInterval members instead
* route::calculateConnectingRoute() shortens the result route by removing overlapping regions with the objects; the length of the connecting route now reflects the distance of the vehicles much better
