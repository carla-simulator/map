 * @struct Line2d
 * @brief Represents a line in a two dimensional space.
 *
 * A line is defined by specifying two points along the line. These two points must be different.
 * A line can be interpreted as an infinite line or as a line segment.
 * For infinite lines the two points specify only two points along the line, without specifying a start/end points.
 * In a line segment the two points act as vertex or endpoints.
 *
 *           < Infinite Line >
 *           Point A              Point B
 *...-----------0--------------------o---------------------------...
 *
 *           < Line segment >
 *            Point A             Point B
 *              0--------------------0
 *
 * The definition of line segment or infinite line plays a crucial role while verifying if the two lines intersect.
 * The intersection of line segments is constrained to the convex hull of the end points.
 * The intersection of infinite lines is not constrained at all.
 *
 * E.g. Lines intersection, (see the graph below):
 * In infinite line intersection the lines intersect at the "x" point.
 * In line segment intersection they don't intersect at all.
 * If line 1 is an infinite line and line 2 is a line segment, then there is no intersection.
 * If line 1 is a line segment and line 2 is an infinite line, then the line 2 intersects line 1.
 *
 *      Line 1
 *        0
 *        |      Line 2
 *        x  0----------------0
